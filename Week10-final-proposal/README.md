## Todo: 
- Integreate Emotion Prediction Model
    - Replace the placeholder random emotion selection in `WebcamCapture.js`with an actual emotion prediction model. 
    - Modify the capture function to call the emotion prediction model with the captured image data.
    - Handle the asynchronous nature of the model prediction to update the UI accordingly.
- Update Image Generation Process
    - Refactor GenerateImage.js to take the predicted emotion and generate an image based on it.
    - Implement a backend service to handle the image generation.
-  Enhance Progress Bar Functionality
    - Adjust the progress bar in GenerateImage.js to reflect the actual progress of the image generation process.
